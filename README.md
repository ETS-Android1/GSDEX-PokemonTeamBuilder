## **Project Statement**


## **Application Design**


## **Implementation & Evaluation**


## **References**
This Project would not have been possible without the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co). Which is a RESTful API that was created to be a single source of data for people wishing to use data on all currently existing Pokemon. When called for a given pokemon name or ID, the API returns JSON objects containing the statistics and relevant data points of that pokemon.  
  
The images used for this project were compiled by github user [_msikma_]([PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co)) and their project PokeSprite. 


## **Experience and Thoughts**
This project was a great learning experience. I got the chance to experiment with integrating SQL queries into Java, RESTful API calls, JSON parsing, as well as many different multithreading techniques. Having an object that could be affected by concurrent threads made implementation complicated, but very rewarding. If I had more time I would have liked to implement more user features, such as a team weakness calculator, team exporting, and add more data points that the user can filter and sort by. I will most likely continue this project in my free time and implement the features that I did not have time to add. Overall, this project and this class both taught me a lot about Mobile Application Development on the Android platform.
